// Public ABI for FCSE (Far Cry Script Extender) plugins.
//
// A plugin is a plain DLL, dropped into bin\plugins\, that exports at least FCSE_Load. FCSE.exe
// loads every plugin DLL right after resolving Dunia.dll, before any Dunia.dll engine code beyond
// its own DllMain/CRT init has run - see the FCSE README for the full lifecycle.
//
// This header has no dependency on the rest of the FCSE source tree - copy it into a plugin
// project as-is. It is the only file a plugin needs.
//
// C plugins get the struct and its function pointers. C++ plugins additionally get the
// Relocation helpers at the bottom, which are what most plugins should use for engine
// addresses.

// This is the entry point most plugins should use, and the one that matches how addresses are
// actually obtained. You open a Dunia.dll in Ghidra, IDA or Cheat Engine, you find a function, and
// what you have is an address *in the build you opened* - so say which build that was:

//

// copy of the game you already have.
//
// The two builds are NOT a fixed distance apart - the offset between them takes 2,608 different
// values across the mapping - so this lookup is the only correct way to translate. Pass the RVA
// (0x0081E9C0) or the VA at Dunia's preferred base (0x1081E9C0); both are accepted, since no real

// `??` is a wildcard byte - two characters per byte, like the hex it replaces, and the only
// spelling accepted. Returns the address of the match, or 0.

//     disk, which has no relationship to the mapped layout.
//   - A pattern matching in more than one place returns 0, not the first hit. Silently taking the
//     first is how a scan patches the wrong function. `outMatchCount` (may be NULL) receives how
//     many sites matched, capped at 64, so you can tighten the pattern; the reason is also logged.

// Build requirements, in full:
//
//   - 32-bit (x86). Far Cry 2 is a 32-bit process; a 64-bit DLL cannot load into it.
//   - Any compiler, any version. This whole header is deliberately pure C - POD structs, function
//     pointers, const char* - with no std:: types, no virtuals and no exceptions crossing the
//     boundary, so a plugin never has to match the toolchain FCSE.exe was built with. (Nor the one
//     the game was built with: FCSE reaches engine internals through hand-declared __thiscall
//     signatures and byte offsets, so Dunia's own layout rules apply regardless.)
//   - /MT (static CRT) is recommended, not required. FCSE.exe uses it so players need no Visual
//     C++ redistributable installed; a /MD plugin works fine but reintroduces that requirement for
//     anyone who installs it. Either way each module carries its own CRT, so the usual rule holds:
//     never free in one module what another allocated. Nothing in this API transfers ownership -
//     strings passed in are copied, and callbacks hand back values, not buffers - so there is no
//     way to trip over that through the API itself.
